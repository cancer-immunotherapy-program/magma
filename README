Magma is a data loader/model system. It has two components:

1. A gem. The gem exposes models which allow you to consume the database and run queries. It also allows you to
   update the schema.

2. A webserver. The webserver accepts JSON posts and updates the database accordingly.

Only the webserver can write to the database - the gem gives you custom loaders
for your models, which produce JSON documents to send to the webserver.
